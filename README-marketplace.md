## Troubleshooting

### Issues when installing from Spicetify Marketplace

```sh
spicetify config current_theme marketplace color_scheme marketplace
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1 inject_theme_js 1
spicetify apply
```

### With the latest Spotify/Spicetify the theme is broken, some visual elements are missing, etc

Spotify releases updates very frequently, and when that happens, it's common for things to break. Generally, we'll be able to fix these issues, but there are certain issues that are out of our control. If you experience such an issue, please report them via the repository's issues page.

### There isn't any blur at all

Open Spotify settings and turn on `Enable hardware acceleration`.

### Some custom app on the left navbar has a wrong icon

Please report about that via the repository's issues page.

### Theme doesn't work correctly with Spotify version less than 1.2.14

Use the [legacy branch](https://github.com/nimsandu/spicetify-bloom/tree/legacy) (unsupported).
